Tools that make my shell life easier.

See bashrc-pack for how I append them to my bashrc.

Most of the tools are implemented in bash or core perl so they don't have
additional dependencies and run directly on any current linux distro.

Most bash scripts depend on my bash-helpers script - so make sure it's
in your path.
